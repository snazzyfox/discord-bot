-WhiskeyDingo, or Whiskey for short, is an avid gamer for the majority of his life. He’d like to share that passion with all of you!

So grab a drink, kick back and enjoy while he makes a fool of myself.

-You want Whiskey to install some handrails in his office so that he is safe and OSHA compliant.
-The chat is full of Nibbles' bot. You are one of them.
